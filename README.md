# Foodtracker
Goal of this project is to create a foodtracker to compare your daily intake with RDA's.
The main target is not only to track macro nutrients (fat, protein, carbonhydrates), but also
micro nutrients (vitamins, trace elements and so on).

Here are some feature ideas:
- Basic DB
    - nutrients + their RDA values
    - Several basic foods (water, oat flakes, vegetables, but also candy bars, ...)
- Profiles for different target audiences (gender, age, etc.)
- Statistics (daily, weekly, ...)
- Recommendations (missing nutrients for today, which evening meal to cook to match remaining RDA's for today)
